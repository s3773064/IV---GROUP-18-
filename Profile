Melanie Lok - s3722982
I was born in Australia, but my ethnicity is half Cambodian and half Chinese. My hobbies include, hiking, bouldering and any sort of outdoor activity that involves a kick of adrenaline. After graduating from High School, I took a gap year then proceeded to do half a semester in an Associate’s Degree of Science. I didn't enjoy it much, so I stopped the course in the second semester to apply for a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology. My main interest in IT is in programming. Although it is frustrating at times and can be very difficult, the end result is satisfying. Having your code run successfully gives a sense of accomplishment, which makes it so enjoyable. Before starting a Bachelor’s Degree in IT, I had very little IT experience, however, my knowledge is growing and I hope to gain more experience.

Each members’ personality test result is as follows: 
Ary: ENTP & Tactile learner
Melanie: ESFP-T & Tactile/Kinesthetic
Patrick: ESFJ-T & Tactile
Derek: ISFJ & Auditory
Angel: ISFJ-T & Visual
Hien: INFP-A & Auditory/Visual

The team consists of three extraverts and three introverts, however, this does not determine our team's compatibility. According to the test results, each member is somewhat compatible with one another. By acknowledging each other's personality type, we are able to gather insights on everyone's strengths and weaknesses in regards to teamwork. One member's weakness is another member's strength. With this in mind, we can use this to our advantage and allocate roles in favour of our strongest traits.
 
Ary's ENTP personality is the type who enjoys thinking in creative ways and as the “thinking type”, is someone who uses logical reasoning rather than acting out of emotion, which is an important trait to have when working in a team. Melanie's type allows her to work well in a team as ESFP's are verbal and assertive, as well as are open to ideas that may challenge their own without conflict. Patrick, as an ESFJ, is someone that is a logical thinker and follows their mind over their heart. They're very organized and intuitive, their strengths being organization and problem-solving. Both Derek and Angel are ISFJ types. The test reflects that though they may be shy, they will get tasks done on time. They're patient with given tasks whilst having a much steady and straight forward approach to help achieve the end goal. Lastly, Hien is an INFP, which are usually the types who bring unity to a team. They're creative and are innovative thinkers who are highly oriented to action. 

The tests are sometimes vague and not always 100% accurate, so regardless of personality type, each member already knows what they are capable of and we will communicate that the more we work together. 

Melanie:
Currently, my ideal job is a Junior Data Scientist. The main focus of the job involves working with businesses and technology teams, while applying data analysis and data modelling skills to enhance company products/services before offering it to clients. This position appeals to me because it is a great graduate level job that requires a lot of teamwork and data analysis, which I enjoy. The job could potentially lead to better opportunities and help further my career goals as a data scientist.
The ideal fields for each group member are: software engineering, data science, data and business intelligence analysis, cyber security and network security. 
One of the common job interests are data science and data/business intelligence analysis, where some of the shared skills include data modelling, knowledge in programming languages, problem solving, creating/analyzing data, expressing data, teamwork and having a decent knowledge in the mathematical field. Another common job interest amongst our team is cybersecurity and network security, where some skills are in risk analysis and mitigation, intrusion detection, security analysis, programming languages and malware analysis and reversing. Although software engineering is of a different field, there are similar skills needed such as programming languages and problem solving. Another required skill that everyone will need is great teamwork and strong communication. 
In software engineering, the focus is on applying concepts of engineering to develop software, which is different from data science and analysis, where they aid businesses and enhance company products through analysing data. There is also a contrast when compared to security, where the attention is on security and data loss prevention with aspects of problem solving. Although each member has a different role of interest, we share a common goal that is to succeed in our careers. In regards to career plans, the team has similarities in which we want to complete our Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology, get internships, begin networking and make our way up in the IT industry.

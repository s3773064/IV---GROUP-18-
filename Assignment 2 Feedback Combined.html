<h1> Ary <h1/>
<p>Angel showed interest to work on our project and was dedicated to the development of the assignment. He were not to be present at a couple of meetings, but he would watch the recordings, read the agenda notes and do the work as required. He also conducted one interview and shared interesting facts from his interviewee.</p>
<p>Derek was a proactive member and committed to take actions and tasks as it was needed. He was punctual for the meetings and contributed with his thoughts to the group discussions. Derek was not afraid to take more tasks if it was needed of him.</p>
<p>Melanie was actively present in all meetings and channels used for communication. She took good care of our agenda, taking notes on designated tasks and pending parts of the assignment. She shared her own project idea with us and was happy to let it become a group project.</p>
<p>Patrick used his technical skills to create a group repository on GitHub, managed the branch master and also helped us use the repository. During the meetings, his contributions also came from his communications skills that engaged the team in discussions. Patrick interviewed an IT worker from overseas and brought in context of what is the industry like in the US.</p>
<p>Because of a big misunderstanding, Hien Tran’s email was added incorrectly in the Microsoft Team and that created some confusion during the project for the team and for him. <br>
Hien had access to our google drive, where we created the documents and kept our agenda, every week he would add his contribution for team profile and ideal jobs as we added ours. This shows that Hien was committed to work on our project. In our last week we finally clarified what was happening and had him added to our meetings.
Hien took care of working on a HTML template and was engaged in the discussion. </p>

<h1> Melanie <h1/>
<p> Ary is almost like the leader of our group. He contributed a lot to the group and was always organised with his tasks and completed them accordingly. His performance was great and was kind to all group members. He was also open to different opinions and ideas, as well as raised his own great ideas. <p/>
<p> Without a fail Derek was organised and on top of his work, additionally volunteering to assist Ary with his workload, also contributing a lot to the group. He participated every meeting and was always prepared. Furthermore, there was never any conflict with him. He shared great ideas and showed that he was serious about this assignment. <p/>
<p> Patrick is always enthusiastic and constantly shared his many ideas. He completed his set tasks consistently and offered to do the technical tasks that no one else could. He was always extremely friendly to every group member and never complained about the workload. <p/>
<p> Angel is kind and regularly completed his tasks. He always seemed enthusiastic about the next set of work assigned to him and would do his part almost immediately when asked. Although he was a bit quiet and shy, he would share his ideas when necessary, adding great comments and contributions. <p/>
<p> There was a bit of confusion on Hien’s part but eventually, it came together. When we were finally able to reach out to him, he showed great technical skills and was eager to do any work that had not already been done. Most of the writing part of the project had been done but he was able to put everything together. <p/>

<h1> Patrick <h1/>
<p>Melanie has been an extremely active member of the group. She is always on task and has been very productive. She has completed all work that was assigned to her and is always first to volunteer when something needs to be completed.</p>
<p>Derek is also very proactive member of the group. He is active in all the communication channels and completes his work without any extra attention needed. He contributed a lot to the project idea, and always has a thought on how we can improve.</p>
<p>Ary has become our primary group leader. He is always pushing the conversation forward and delegating jobs to people. He is a good personality and a great group member and contributor. He has a great understanding of the assignment and has good thoughts on what we should do. He brings a different point of view being from Brazil and how the IT industry is there.</p>
<p>Hien has a bit of tricky scenario because of a big mix up of him only being added to our Google Doc collaboration assignments and not our Microsoft Teams group. As well in Canvas an alternative Hien Tran was added to our group there as well creating a massive confusion. However, once he joined the group, he brought great HTML knowledge with him. He has been a big help in creating our website and putting all our contributions together onto the website.</p>

<h1> Derek <h1/>
<p> Patrick was the commanding leader of GitHub, who had the most experience out of all the members. He was also willing to help the group members if they are confused or stuck on using GitHub. He attended most of the meetings that were scheduled and if he wasn't able to come he had a very good reason why he couldn't attend. However, he was proactive as if he didn't attend the meeting then he would watch the recording and ask the group what tasks have been completed and that needs to be done by the next meeting. <p/>
<p> Melanie attended all the meetings and pre planned all the tasks that needs to be completed in every meeting which showed that she was very organised. She could communicate with the group members freely and could express her own person opinion to the group.

<p> Ary was the leader of the group, who was able to tasks done on time and did any extra tasks that needed to help make our work better. He acted like leader, who was able to communicate freely and effectively with every other group member. If anyone in the group needed to complete any extra task, he would the first person to offer. <p/>
<p> Hien was able to join back and contribute to our group even he joined back late, he was still able to contribute in the group document and find any exra tasks that needs to be completed and contribute to the group. <p/>
